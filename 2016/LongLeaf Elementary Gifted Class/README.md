For 2 years in a row, I have been invited to my daughter's elementary school to discuss programming. This year I did two presentations over the course of 4 days. 75 students and 2 teachers attended these presentations.
The first presentation, "My Robotic Friends" is an exercise that shows the children how to pseudo code. The children break up into small programming teams and choose one team mate to be the "robot". The remaining team members are the "programmers". Their task is to program the robot to build the image provided.

The second presentation, "HTML, CSS, and JavaScript" is a crash course in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The kids completed this exercise using their Chromebooks and jsBin.com
